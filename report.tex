\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this project is to advance the state of the art in numerical simulation of infinite 2D systems using projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) by extending the algorithm described in X.  In the first part of this report, we shall review the 1D simulation algorithm that this project extends, and then in the second part we shall review progress made in developing a 2D algorithm based on it.
