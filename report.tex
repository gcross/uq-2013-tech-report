\part*{Introduction}

It can be very useful to study systems in the infinite limit for two reasons.  First, because for sufficiently large systems (and finite-scale boundary effects) the vast majority of the system will be in the bulk far from the boundaries and so the system will effectively act as if were infinite large.  Second, because even if a system has non-trivial boundary effects it is still useful to be able to break down the total behavior into a bulk properties component and a boundary effects component.
