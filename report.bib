  abstract = {An algorithm is presented which computes a translationally invariant
	matrix product state approximation of the ground state of an infinite
	1D system; it does this by embedding sites into an approximation
	of the infinite ``environment'' of the chain, allowing the sites
	to relax, and then merging them with the environment in order to
	refine the approximation. By making use of matrix product operators,
	our approach is able to directly model any long-range interaction
	that can be systematically approximated by a series of decaying exponentials.
	We apply our techniques to compute the ground state of the Haldane-Shastry
	model and present results.},
